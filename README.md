I'm Sumanth balaji, a 21 year old student currently studying at [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad ](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), Hyderbad initially hailing from Chennai. I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and  Masters of Science in Computational Linguistics by Research. I currently work in the [Information Retrieval and Extraction Lab](https://irel.iiit.ac.in/) working on problems such as Style Transfer, Guided Summarisation, Hate Speech and more. I am competant in C++, Java, Python along with multitudes of frameworks.   

I'm really interested in applying NLP solutions to products and problems. I also have major interest in startups and opensource projects, having starting my own startup(in hush-hush mode rn) and opensource projects (check out [bunkbot](https://github.com/sujaysathya/bunk_bot), a Python script that attends your online classes and answers very basic questions for you in your place). You might find more about me by just looking through my repositories.

## Contact Me!

I'm highly interested in contributing to any open-source project I can. If you want to work together, or show me a place/repository to contribute to, contact me!
